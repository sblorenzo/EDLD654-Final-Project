**Research Problem**
<div align="left">The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been (and continue to be) felt across the world, dramatically altering societal norms and interactions. Due to the immediate devastation and residual impacts prompted by the virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other governmental institutes around the globe responded by recommending (and in many cases, enforcing) the practice of social distancing through stay-at-home orders (Matias et al., 2020). While this tactic aimed to slow the spread of COVID-19, it also resulted in mass isolation, increasing peopleâ€™s vulnerability by restricting access to basic human needs (i.e., healthcare, resources, and social connections; Matias et al., 2020). The pandemic also amplified digital media use, allowing for social applications such as Twitter to garner rapid popularity (Bellan, 2020).
